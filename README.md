### Original Project Instructions from Creative Market:

The code challenge is straight-forward; re-create this page:
https://creativemarket.com/account/credits

You’re free to use any PHP and JS framework you prefer. You do not have to re-create the supporting “layout” CSS (e.g. the header, footer) - but you do need to write brand-new CSS for the primary components:

1. The “selection cards” up top
2. The credit card widget below

Other notes:

- It does not have to hook up to Stripe or do anything real with payments
- The form does not need to submit
- You’re allowed to ask any questions you want on Slack, collaborate as much as you need
- You have a three-hour time ... goal. Talk to us if you don't think you'd go over. 
- If you’re pressed for time, you can skip the “PayPal card” option and just focus on the credit card widget
- Please store everything in a Git repository, commit along the way
